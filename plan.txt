1. A basic log-based distributed queue.
2. No topics
3. Only partitions
4. Append only log for storage.
5. producers are there
6. consumers are there
7. no replication of data


Start with the Server:

1. Each server has a partition index.
2. Enqueue - add enqueue message to append only log
3. Dequeue - add dequeue message to append only log
4. In-memory michael-scott queue
5. On file log

Eventual goal:

Implement zero copy like Kafka.
